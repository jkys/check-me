## Acknowledgments

* Thank you to the great developers from Firebase, without the great development work and platform they have created, it would have been a much longer road to be able to implement the features we had planned.
* Thank you to the Facebook and Twitter API for the great documentation and intuitive REST standards.
* Thank you to Professor Suresh from Wentworth Institute of Technology who has helped, guided, and shoved us on our way to creating this project and to become the people and developers we are today.
