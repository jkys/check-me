            Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials (information or software) on CheckMe's website for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:
            <ol type="i">
              <li>modify or copy the materials;</li>
              <li>use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public display (commercial or non-commercial);</li>
